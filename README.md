# WELCOME TO MY PORTFOLIOo


I am all about learning new skills and deep diving into new concepts / code that I am not familiar with. I love learning, researching and planning the next best move to reach my end goal. Of course with roadblocks, nothing comes easy but with some will and hard work there is always a way.

I was born and raised my whole life in Clifton, NJ. I am 24 years old currently and am looking for my first opporunity in the software industry. I graduated with a Bachelors in Chemical Engineering, however, I wanted to learn more and align my life with bigger things. I would love to work and develop in the Cloud, ML and AI space in the near future. I also love working on software applications and think being part of a company that owns their own is very lucartive to the company to my knowledge.
